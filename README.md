# Research Agent ðŸ”Ž

### Overview
Research Agent is a powerful tool that combines SERP API and Hugging Face's NLP capabilities to provide users with detailed research and summarization results. It allows you to explore topics using web search (optional) and generates meaningful summaries from the extracted text. This app is built using **Streamlit**, making it highly accessible and easy to use.

---

### Features
- **Optional SERP API Integration**: Run web searches and extract relevant sources or directly summarize your input question.
- **Summarization with Hugging Face**: Summarize extracted articles or the user-provided text for concise and structured insights.
- **Dynamic Token Selection**: Use a default token or your own Hugging Face token for custom configurations.
- **Customizable Results**: Choose the number of search results to retrieve and summarize.
- **Point-Based Summaries**: Present summaries as structured key points for better readability.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed with a wide layout and sidebar options for seamless interaction.

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the Research Agent locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arshad-ashuu/agent_rea.git
    cd research-agent
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python installed. Install required libraries using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    Use Streamlit to launch the app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

---

### Configuration
#### SERP API Key
- Optional: The SERP API key enables web search capabilities to retrieve articles for summarization.
- Set your SERP API key in the sidebar or leave it blank for direct summarization of your input question.

#### Hugging Face Token
- Optional: Use a Hugging Face token for summarization tasks. You can use the default token provided or input your own token via the sidebar.

---

### Usage
1. Enter a research question in the input box.
2. Configure the number of search results (if SERP API is available).
3. Run the Research Agent by clicking the **Run Research Agent** button.
4. Review summarized results and combined key points under the **Final Summary** section.

### Example
Hereâ€™s an example workflow:
1. Question: _How does Bitcoin work?_
2. SERP API key: Not required (optional).
3. Results: Web links, summaries, and final consolidated insights.

Output:
```
1. Source: https://example.com/bitcoin-basics
   Summary:
   - Bitcoin operates on a decentralized blockchain system.
   - Transactions are verified by miners using cryptographic algorithms.

ðŸ“˜ Combined Final Summary:
1. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized blockchain system.
2. Transactions are verified by miners using cryptographic algorithms.
3. It provides transparency and security in digital transactions.
```
